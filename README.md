Elastest Orchestration Engine
=============================

The ElasTest Orchestration Engine (EOE) is the component responsible of implementing the concept of orchestration within Elastest, understood as a novel way to select, order, and execute a group of TJobs. To that aim, we have leveraged the pipelines Jenkins notation for the topology generation by means of a [Jenkins shared library]. This library exposes a simple API to orchestrate testing jobs. The orchestrator library API is summarized in the following table:

Method | Description
--- | ---
`runJob(String jobId)` |  Method to run a job given its identifier (*jobId*).This method returns a boolean value: `true` if the execution of the job finishes correctly and `false` if fails
`runJobDependingOn(boolean verdict, String job1Id, String job2Id)` |  Method allows to run one job given a boolean value (typically a verdict from another job). This boolean value is passes in the first argument (called verdict in the method signature). If this value job with identifier `job1Id` is executed. Otherwise it is executed `job2Id`
`runJobsInParallel(String... jobs)` |  This method allows to run a set of jobs in parallel. The jobs identifier are passes using a variable number of arguments (*varargs*)

Moreover, the exit condition for the orchestrated job can be also configured:

Method | Description
--- | ---
`EXIT_AT_END` |  The orchestration finishes at the end (option by default)
`EXIT_ON_FAIL` |  The orchestration finishes when any of the TJobs fail
`EXIT_ON_PARALLEL_FAILURE` |  The orchestration finishes when any a set of parallel TJobs fail

Finally, the verdict of a group of parallel jobs can be also configured:

Method | Description
--- | ---
`AND` |  The verdict of a set of jobs executed in parallel is `true` only if all the jobs finish correctly
`OR` |  The verdict of parallel jobs is `true` when at least one of the jobs finishes correctly

Other configurations:

Method | Description | Use Example
--- | --- | ---
`setPacketLoss` | If a SuT instrumented By ElasTest through EIM is used, one or more packet loss values can be set. If more than one is specified, the job will be run as many times as there are values. | setPacketLoss(['0.01', '0.02'])
`setCpuBurst` | If a SuT instrumented By ElasTest through EIM is used, one or more cpu burst (stress) values can be set. If more than one is specified, the job will be run as many times as there are values. | setCpuBurst(['0.2'])
`checkTime` | Allows to check if an execution lasts less (LessThan) or more (GreaterThan) than the indicated time (In milliseconds, seconds, minutes, etc.). | checkTime(Compare.LessThan, 60, TimeUnit.SECONDS)

At the moment, only packet loss and cpu burst can be set separately, so the two cannot be set at the same time.

What is ElasTest
-----------------

This repository is part of [ElasTest], which is a flexible open source testing
platform aimed to simplify the end-to-end testing processes for different types
of applications, including web and mobile, among others.

The objective of ElasTest is to provide advance testing capabilities aimed to
increase the scalability, robustness, security and quality of experience of
large distributed systems. All in all, ElasTest will make any software
development team capable of delivering software faster and with fewer defects.
